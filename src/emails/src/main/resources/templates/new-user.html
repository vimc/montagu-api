            This is an automated email from

            receiving this email because a new account has been created for
            you on Montagu, the digital delivery platform for the Vaccine
            Impact Modelling Consortium.

We will never share this information outside of the core delivery team, and it will only be used for security audits and to plan how to improve Montagu. (For example, if there is a feature that nobody is using, that might tell us something is wrong with it!)</li>
