# Responsibilities
## GET /modelling-groups/{modelling-group-id}/responsibilities/
Will return list of touchstones that this modelling group is responsible for.

Touchstones that are `in-preparation` should not be returned unless the user has
permission to see touchstones before they are made `open`.

Required permissions: Global scope: `touchstones.read`. Scoped to modelling group: `responsibilities.read`. Also see note above about `in-preparation` touchstones - need `touchstones.prepare`.

Schema: [`Touchstones.schema.json`](../schemas/Touchstones.schema.json)

### Example
    [
        {
            "id": "op-2017-1",
            "name": "op-2017",
            "version": 1,
            "description": "2017 Operational Forecast",
            "status": "finished"
        }
    ]
    
## GET /modelling-groups/{modelling-group-id}/responsibilities/{touchstone-id}/
Returns an enumerations of the responsibilities of this modelling group in the given touchstone,
and the overall status of this modelling groups work in this touchstone.

If the touchstone is `in-preparation`, and the user does not have permission to see touchstones 
before they are made `open`, then this returns an error 404.

Required permissions: Global scope: `scenarios.read`. Scoped to modelling group: `responsibilities.read`. Additionally, to view responsibilities for an `in-preparation` touchstone, the user needs the `touchstones.prepare` permission.

If they have no responsibilities, `status` is "not-applicable".

        "responsibilities": []
    }

Note that even if a modelling group has no responsibilities in a given touchstone,
using this endpoint is not an error: an empty array will just be returned.

## GET /modelling-groups/{modelling-group-id}/responsibilities/{touchstone-id}/{scenario-id}/
Returns the specified responsibility of this modelling group in the given touchstone.

before they are made `open`, then this returns an error 404.

Required permissions: Global scope: `scenarios.read`. Scoped to modelling group: `responsibilities.read`. Additionally, to view responsibilities for an `in-preparation` touchstone, the user needs the `touchstones.prepare` permission.

## PATCH /modelling-groups/{modelling-group-id}/responsibilities/{touchstone-id}/
**NOT IMPLEMENTED**

Allows you to change the status of the responsibility set.

Can only move the responsibility set to `submitted` if:

* The status is `incomplete`
* All responsibilities have the status `valid`

Required permissions: `estimates.submit`, scoped to the modelling group (or *)

Schema: [`EditResponsibilitySet.schema.json`](../schemas/EditResponsibilitySet.schema.json)

### Example
    {
        "status": "submitted"
    }

Users in the reviewer role can change the status of the responsibility set when it is in `submitted`. 
They can change it to either `incomplete` or `approved`. If they change it to incomplete, they must include
at least one problem.

Required permissions: `estimates.review`, scoped to the modelling group (or *)

Schema: [`EditResponsibilitySet.schema.json`](../schemas/EditResponsibilitySet.schema.json)

### Example
    {
        "status": "incomplete",
        "problems": "Please review the numbers for Afghanistan - they look much too high"
    }
